Category: sectors
HTTP: 200

To employ migrant workers for the services sector, you have to meet specific requirements for business activity, worker’s source country or region, quota and levy. Find out how you can meet these criteria.
These requirements are additional and specific to the services sector. You should also refer to the general Work Permit conditions and requirements.
Types of business activities
Your company can be considered to be under the services sector if it has registered any of the following as its principal business activity:
- Financial, insurance, real estate, infocomm and business services.
- Transport, storage and communications services.
- Commerce (retail and wholesale trade).
- Community, social and personal services (excluding domestic workers).
- Hotels.
- Restaurants, coffee shops, food courts and other approved food establishments (excluding food stalls or hawker stalls).
Licences for food establishments are issued by Singapore Food Agency (SFA). Only operators with foodshop licences issued by SFA are allowed to employ migrant workers. The SFA licence must bear the name of the company, sole proprietor or partner.
For private limited and limited liability partnership (LLP) companies, we do not accept licences bearing the name of an individual.
Migrant worker eligibility
You can only hire migrant workers who meet the conditions for source countries or regions and age requirements when applying.
Source countries or regions
You can employ migrant workers from these countries or regions:
- Malaysia
- People’s Republic of China (PRC)
- North Asian sources (NAS):
- Hong Kong (HKSAR passport)
- Macau
- South Korea
- Taiwan
You can employ migrant workers from Non-Traditional Sources (NTS) for a restricted set of occupations in the
NTS Occupation List.
Age requirements
The minimum age for all non-domestic migrant workers is 18 years old.
When applying for a Work Permit, all non-domestic migrant workers (regardless of nationality) must be below 61 years old.
Work Permit holders can work any number of years, and up to a maximum age of 63 years old.
Quota and levy
The number of Work Permit holders that you can hire is limited by a quota (or dependency ratio ceiling, DRC) and subject to a levy.
The DRC for the services sector is 35%. The levy rates are tiered so that those who hire close to the maximum quota will pay a higher levy.
The levy rate and tiers for the services sector are as follows:
|

Basic-skilled – monthly
|
Basic-skilled – daily

Calculate your quota
Note: The daily levy rate only applies to Work Permit holders who did not work for a full calendar month. The daily levy rate is calculated as follows: (Monthly levy rate x 12) / 365 = rounding up to the nearest cent.
For companies that exceed the new DRCs, they will:
- Be allowed to keep their excess workers until the Work Permits expire.
- Not be able to apply for new or renew Work Permits in excess of the DRC.
Qualifying for higher-skilled worker levy
You pay less levy for higher-skilled migrant workers. You can apply for the higher-skilled worker levy rate for workers who meet the following requirements:
