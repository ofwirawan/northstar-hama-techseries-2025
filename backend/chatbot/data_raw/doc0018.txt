(For employers) File a notice-pay claim for mediation

Things to note
| Who can file | Company’s Corppass users who are assigned the access to "EmPOWER" in Corppass |
|---|---|
| Filing fees for mediation |
Fees are not refundable and are based on the claim amount declared when you file. |
| Payment methods |
You can pay online by:
OR Kiosk at TADM Services Centres during operating hours (Visa or MasterCard credit or debit cards, NETS Card, NETS Flashpay, NETS QR Payment, EZ-Link) Payment must be made within 3 days from the date of filing. A claim is successfully filed only upon receipt of payment. If payment is not received within 3 days, the claim will be purged and you will need to refile the claim. |
| How long it takes |
Within 3 working days of payment, you will receive an email from TADM on the next steps of the dispute resolution process. |
Employers can only claim for notice pay (also known as ‘salary in lieu of notice’). The employee must be covered under the Employment Act for you to claim.
You need to file within 6 months of the employee’s last day of employment.
You should first attempt to recover the notice pay from your former employee. For example, by sending them a letter to recover the payment.
Give them a reasonable period to respond. If there is no response, you may then file your claim for mediation.
