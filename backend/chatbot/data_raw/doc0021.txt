Why hire an existing worker
You may consider hiring workers who are already working in Singapore to:
- Benefit from experienced workers and a faster deployment time.
- Save on the cost of bringing in new workers.
Transferring existing workers with current employer's agreement
If the current employer agrees, you can apply for existing workers while their Work Permits are valid. Their Work Permit must have a remaining validity of at least 14 days.
Apply for a transfer worker
To apply for a new Work Permit for the transfer:
- Follow the general Work Permit application process.
- If the worker is eligible for the transfer, an SMS or email will be sent to the existing employer. The existing employer need to log in to WP Online to agree or reject the transfer, within 5 working days. If consent is not given by the existing employer, the Work Permit application submitted will be automatically rejected.
- Upon approval, you can proceed to get the new Work Permit issued. The existing Work Permit will be automatically cancelled once you get the new one issued.
If the worker's Work Permit is expiring in less than 14 days, you first need to apply for pre-approval from MOM. You will need the existing employer to sign the consent form.
When the workers’ Work Permits are within 40 to 21 days from expiry, you can apply for new Work Permits for them without their employer’s consent.
To apply for a new Work Permit for the transfer:
- apply for pre-approval
- Once pre-approval is obtained, you can apply for a new Work Permit
- Upon approval, you need to get the work permit issued.
You can only request for the Work Permit to be issued when the current permit has been cancelled or expires.
- If you (new employer) need an earlier transfer, have a discussion with the worker and existing employer to come to an agreement on when to cancel the existing Work Permit.
- Once the new Work Permit is issued, you (new employer) are responsible for the workers’ upkeep and maintenance. Make sure you arrange acceptable accommodation for the worker before you take over the employment.
As an existing employer, what could I do to keep my workers
As an existing employer, you are given priority to renew your workers’ Work Permits.
If you want to keep your workers, you should renew their Work Permits early, upon receiving the renewal notice.
When your workers’ Work Permits are within 40 to 21 days from expiry, another employer can apply for new Work Permits for them without your consent.
If the new employer’s application is approved:
- You can continue to employ the worker, as long as the existing Work Permit is valid.
- You will remain responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the workers until the new Work Permit is issued under the new employer.
- You are responsible for settling any outstanding salary while the worker was under your employment.
