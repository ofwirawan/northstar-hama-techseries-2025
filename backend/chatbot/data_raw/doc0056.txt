If your company is a non-sponsoring shipyard or common contractor, you will need to get prior approval (PA) before you can apply for or renew a Work Permit. The PA reference number must be provided in the Work Permit application or renewal.
What is prior approval
PA is an approval for companies to employ migrant workers from NTS countries and the People’s Republic of China (PRC).
PA indicates the number of migrant workers the company is allowed to employ from these countries. It also determines the number of workers who can have their Work Permits renewed, or who can be transferred from another company in Singapore.
