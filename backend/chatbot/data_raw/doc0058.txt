As an employer of migrant workers, you must comply with a set of Work Permit conditions during their employment.
A Work Permit (WP) is generally issued to unskilled or semi-skilled migrant workers.
The Work Permit duration is generally 2 years, subject to the validity of the worker’s passport, the security bond and the worker’s employment period, whichever is shorter.
The worker is only allowed to work for the employer and in the specified occupation.
Work Permit conditions
Employers and Work Permit holders must comply with the Conditions of Work Permits.
As an employer of Work Permit holders, you must meet the following requirements:
- Only employ workers with a valid Work Permit.
- Pay workers their fixed monthly salaries declared to MOM.
- Pay workers their salaries and the cost of their upkeep and maintenance, including the cost of medical treatment.
- Ensure workers have proper housing.
- Buy and maintain medical insurance for each worker to cover in-patient care and surgery costs.
- From 1 April 2022, buy and maintain Primary Care Plan for each worker to cover out-patient primary care costs.
- Send workers for a medical examination by a Singapore-registered doctor. If they are certified medically unfit, their Work Permits will be revoked.
- Pay the monthly foreign worker levy for each worker.
- Buy a security bond for each non-Malaysian worker.
- Not demand or receive any sum or other benefit from an employment agency or any other person in connection with the employment or change in employment of a worker.
Work Permit holders must comply with the following:
- Work only for the employer and in the occupation and sector specified in their Work Permit.
- Not take part in any other business or start their own business.
- Reside only at the address set by the employer at the start of employment. They must inform their employers if they plan to move to another place.
- Show their digital work pass in the SGWorkPass app or their Work Permit card when requested by any public officer.
Encourage your worker to use their digital work pass in the SGWorkPass app for verification when required to lower their risk of losing or damaging their physical card.
- Not marry a Singapore citizen or permanent resident in or outside Singapore without MOM's approval. This applies even after their Work Permits have expired, been cancelled or revoked.
- Not get pregnant or deliver a child in Singapore during the validity of their Work Permit unless they are already married to a Singapore citizen or permanent resident with MOM's approval. This applies even after their Work Permits have expired, been cancelled or revoked.
When employment ends
If the employment is completed or terminated, or if the worker resigns, you must:
- Cancel the Work Permit within 1 week after the worker's last day of notice.
- Bear the cost of repatriation, including buying an air ticket with check-in luggage allowance.
- Settle all outstanding employment issues, including salary payment.
