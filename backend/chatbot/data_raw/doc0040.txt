To view work pass-related data:
To check if you have access:
- Log in to your Corppass account.

If myMOM Portal is not listed as one of your assigned eServices, please ask your Corppass admin or sub-admin to assign the eService to you.
Please check with your Corppass admin if you have the access to the requested data, or if the data is available for your company.
For work pass-related data, we perform additional checks on the EP eService and WP Online administrators and users to ensure that only eligible persons can perform work pass transactions.
The administrator can:
- Grant access to the company’s employees as EP eService users.
- Terminate users’ access if they leave the company or no longer need access.
You should appoint a second administrator. This will minimise any disruption to your business in case one of the administrators is not around or leaves the company.
To prevent unauthorised transactions, follow these steps:
1. Submit the authorisation form to authorise the service provider's staff.
The form must be submitted by an authorised representative of the organisation, such as the organisation's appointed officer listed in ACRA.
