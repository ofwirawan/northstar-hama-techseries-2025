No.
The Work Permit card is issued to the worker, and must be held by the worker at all times for proper identification.
As an employer, you must not keep the Work Permit cards of your migrant workers or migrant domestic workers.
Employers should:
- Provide your workers with the means to keep their Work Permit cards and other belongings securely, such as lockers, etc, with unrestricted access.
- Advise your workers to keep their Work Permit cards safely on their own. They should not ask you to keep it for them.
- Not force your workers to give youâ€™re their Work Permit cards.
- Encourage your workers to use their digital work pass in the SGWorkPass app for verification when required.
Digital work passes are free and available immediately upon set up of the SGWorkPass app. Guide your workers to download SGWorkPass app and set up their digital work pass if they have not done so. Help them to register or reset their Singpass, if needed.
If your employer insist on keeping your Work Permit card, you can contact MOM for help.
