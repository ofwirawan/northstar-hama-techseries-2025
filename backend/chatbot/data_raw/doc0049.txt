HTTP: 200

To employ migrant workers for the process sector, you will have to meet specific requirements for business activity, worker's source country or region, quota and safety courses.
These requirements are additional and specific to the process sector. You should also refer to the general Work Permit conditions and requirements.
Types of business activities
The process sector includes plants in the manufacturing of petroleum, petrochemicals, specialty chemicals and pharmaceutical products.
The production processes of these plants in the process sector involve specialised equipment and machinery. The construction and maintenance of the production units within these plants, which are classified as process construction and maintenance (PCM) works, require niche skills and expertise.
Such works are carried out by PCM contractors. They work with the process plant owners and engineering, procurement and construction companies to build and maintain the production units of the process plants.
Company requirements
A business providing PCM services to plants must be a corporate member of the Association of the Process Industry (ASPRI). Before it can recruit foreign PCM workers, the business must also be endorsed by ASPRI as a PCM contractor and be included in the PCM Controlled List.
For more information on membership and registration, refer to ASPRI’s website.

Quota and levy
The number of Work Permit holders that you can hire is limited by quota (or dependency ratio ceiling) and subject to a levy.
Under the process sector quota, you can employ 5 Work Permit holders for every local employee who earns the Local Qualifying Salary.
