Title: FAQ: keep passport (no)
Category: protection
HTTP: 200

Employers should not keep the passports of their migrant workers or migrant domestic workers (MDWs). They should also not force their workers to give them their passport.
The passport belongs to the bearer and the issuing authority of the bearerâ€™s country/region of origin.
According to the Passports Act, it is an offence to keep or withhold any passport which does not belong to you.
Good employers provide their workers with means to keep their passports and other belongings securely, such as a locker. The worker must have unrestricted access to the passport and belongings.
Workers whose employers insist on withholding their passport can contact MOM for assistance.
