You may amend a claim if the claim has not been served on the respondent. If you have already served the claim on the respondent, you will not be able to make amendments unless you have obtained permission from the ECT.
To make an amendment to your application, select Request for Amendments under the Online Applications tab on CJTS. Upon the approval of your amendment application, you are required to serve the case management conference notice (Claim Amendment) on the Respondent. Thereafter, you are required to file the Declaration of Service and attach the evidence of such service (e.g. evidence of the service by post) to the Declaration of Service.
You must file a declaration of service (DOS) with proof of service after serving the Notice of CMC on the respondent.
Log in to CJTS. Under the Online Applications tab, select Declaration of Service and follow the instructions.

If a settlement is not reached, or if an application for a consent order is not approved by the ECT, you will have to attend the CMC as stated in the Notice of CMC.
A response sets out the respondent's defence to your claim, which they will be relying on.
A counterclaim can be filed only after you and the respondent have first gone through mediation at TADM in respect of the counterclaim.
