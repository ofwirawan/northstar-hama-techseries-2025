IMPORTANT CONTEXT FOR MIGRANT WORKERS:
The salaries for Foreign Domestic Workers (FDW) and some other migrant workers are lower than these cost of living figures. 
This is because the employer provides accommodation and food, which are the two biggest expenses shown above (rental and dining out/groceries). 
A migrant worker's salary is meant for personal use and to send money home to their family, not to cover the full cost of living like a local or an EP holder.
