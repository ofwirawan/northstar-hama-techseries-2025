Qualifications
Declaring qualifications is optional.
If you do declare your candidates’ qualification in the work pass application, you are responsible for ensuring that your candidate’s qualification:
- Is authentic
- Was awarded by an accredited institution in the application form's drop-down list
Use the Self-Assessment Tool (SAT) to check a candidate's eligibility before you apply.
If the SAT shows that the candidate is not eligible, you shouldn’t apply for the S Pass because it will be rejected.
If the SAT shows that the candidate is eligible, there is around a 90% chance that the candidate will get a pass.
Passes for family members
Pass holders who have a fixed monthly salary of at least $6,000, are eligible for a Dependant’s Pass for their spouse and children.
Employers can submit the application together with the S Pass application or separately at a later date.
