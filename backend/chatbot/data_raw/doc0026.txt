From 1 January 2023, all employers must ensure their MDWs have at least one rest day each month that cannot be compensated away.
However, if you and your MDW mutually agree for her to work on the remainder of her rest days, you must pay her at least 1 day’s salary for each rest day she does not take on top of her monthly salary.
Note: 1 day’s salary can be calculated by dividing her monthly salary by 26 working days, as there are typically 4 weeks and therefore 4 rest days in a month.
| Your FDW’s monthly salary |
$650 |
| Number of rest days not used in a month |
2 |
| 1 day’s salary |
$650 ÷ 26 = $25 |
| Payment for rest days not used |
$25 × 2 = $50 |
| You should pay |
$650 + $50 = $700 |
