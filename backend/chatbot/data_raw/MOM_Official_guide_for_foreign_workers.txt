IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: 
This information is from an official MOM guide published in May 2011. While the core principles and laws (like employer obligations, safety rules, and general rights) remain valid, specific figures (like agency fee caps and salary thresholds) may have changed.
Always cross-check the latest official information on the MOM website: www.mom.gov.sg 

The following is a summary of the 2011 guide:
1. Core Requirement: Work Permit
* All foreign workers must have a valid Work Permit.
* The permit is tied to a specific employer and specific occupation. Working for anyone else or in any other job is illegal.
* Workers must carry their original Work Permit card at all times.
* Violating Work Permit conditions can lead to cancellation and a ban from future employment in Singapore.
2. Key Work Permit Conditions
* Marriage & Pregnancy: Strictly prohibited to marry a Singapore Citizen/Permanent Resident or to become pregnant/deliver a child in Singapore without prior approval from the Controller of Work Permits. This rule applies even after the permit expires or is cancelled.
* Residence: Must live only at the address provided by the employer. Any change must be reported to the employer.
* Medical Examination: Must undergo and pass a medical exam by a Singapore-registered doctor.
3. Employer Obligations

    * Safe working conditions.
    * Acceptable accommodation.
    * upkeep and maintenance, including medical treatment.
* Employers are prohibited from:
    * Demanding or receiving any payment from the worker for employment.
    * Recovering any employment-related expenses from the worker.
4. Agency Fee Regulations
* Fee Cap: Workers should not pay more than the equivalent of one month's salary per year of the work permit/contract (whichever is shorter) to the Singapore employment agency.
    * The total fee is capped at a maximum of two months' salary, even for contracts longer than two years.
    * This cap includes any fees transferred from a home country agent to the Singapore agency.
* Receipts: Singapore agencies must provide receipts for any fees paid.
* Refund: If employment is terminated by the employer within the first 6 months, the agency must refund at least 50% of the fee.
5. Employment Rights & Benefits
Workers are protected under Singapore's Employment Act. Key entitlements include:
* Rest Day: One unpaid rest day per week. If worked, must be paid 2 days' salary.
