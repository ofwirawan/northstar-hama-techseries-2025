If your insurer asks for your worker’s FIN or your organisation’s CPF Submission Number, you can find them on the worker’s in-principle approval (IPA) letter or renewal notice. For new workers, the FIN will be assigned 1 working day after the Work Permit application is approved. Please regenerate the IPA to get the FIN before buying the security bond.
- The security bond must also take effect when the workers arrive. Otherwise, the immigration officer will not allow them to enter. We are unable to change the security bond effective date to allow the workers to enter Singapore, and you will have to send them home immediately.
