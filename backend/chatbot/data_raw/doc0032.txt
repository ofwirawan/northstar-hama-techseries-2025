You must buy a security bond for each non-Malaysian worker you employ. You can buy the bond at any bank or insurance company.
What is a security bond
A security bond is a binding pledge to pay the government if either you or your worker breaks the law, Work Permit conditions or security bond conditions. The bond is in the form of a banker’s or insurer’s guarantee.
You must buy a $5,000 security bond for each non-Malaysian Work Permit holder you employ. You cannot ask your worker to pay for the bond.
When to buy the bond
Before your worker arrives in Singapore, you must:
- Buy a security bond. When buying the security bond, please inform the bank or insurer of the template to be used:
| If buying the bond from the |
Use this template |
| Bank |
MOM_SB_MW |
| Insurer |

The bank or insurer has to indicate the beneficiary in the guarantee’s template as the Ministry of Manpower.
- Inform your bank or insurer to send us the security bond details. It takes up to 3 working days.
If your bank or insurer asks for your worker’s FIN or your organisation’s CPF Submission Number, you can find them on the worker’s in-principle approval (IPA) or renewal notice. For new workers, the FIN will be assigned 1 working day after the Work Permit application is approved. Please regenerate the IPA to get the FIN before buying the security bond.
- Ensure that the security bond takes effect when your worker arrives.
- Log in to WP Online to check the security bond status and print the security bond acknowledgement letter. Send your worker a copy of the letter.
If the security bond is not in effect when your worker arrives in Singapore, the immigration officer will not allow them to enter. We are unable to change the security bond effective date to allow the worker to enter Singapore. You will have to send them home immediately.
When will the bond be discharged
You will be discharged from the security bond liability for a worker only if you meet all of these conditions:
- You have cancelled the Work Permit.
- The worker has returned home.
- You did not breach any of the conditions of the security bond.
If all conditions are met, the security bond will usually be discharged one week after the worker left Singapore.
You’ll be notified by post when the security bond is discharged.
When the bond will be forfeited
Your security bond may be forfeited if any of these happens:
- You or your worker violates any of the following:
- You don’t pay your worker’s salary on time.
- You fail to send your worker home when the Work Permit is expired, revoked or cancelled.
- Your worker goes missing.
- You did not send your construction, marine shipyard or process sector (CMP) worker for the Onboard programme at the Onboard centre.
You will not be liable for your workers’ violations (such as those relating to pregnancy) if you can prove that you have:
- Informed them of the Work Permit conditions they must comply with.
- Reported a violation when you first become aware of it.
