Title: Cross-deploy a worker
Category: sectors
HTTP: 200

If you are in the construction or process sector, you can temporarily deploy your migrant workers to another contractor in the same sector during a lull period.
What is cross-deployment
With cross-deployment, you can post your construction or process workers to work for another company in the same industry during lull periods.
You can cross-deploy workers only if you are in the
construction or process industry. The workers must perform similar work within the same industry.
What to do for cross-deployment
If you are the original employer, you still need to:
- Pay the workers' salaries and levies.
- Provide housing and workmenâ€™s insurance for them.
You will continue to be responsible for the well-being and maintenance of your cross-deployed workers. In addition, there should only be one standing contract of deployment at any one time.
Before cross-deployment, verify that the other company is eligible to take in workers. You can do the verification using

For more details on cross-deployment of
construction workers, refer to the additional regulatory conditions found in Part V of the Fourth Schedule of the Conditions of Work Passes.
